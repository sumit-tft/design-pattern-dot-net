# Design Patterns Examples

This repository contains examples of various design patterns implemented in C#.

## Patterns Implemented

### 1. Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

**Example**: A logging system where only one instance of the logger is required throughout the application.

### 2. Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

**Example**: A vehicle manufacturing system where different factories produce different types of vehicles.

### 3. Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

**Example**: A user interface toolkit where different factories produce UI components with consistent themes.

### 4. Builder Pattern

The Builder Pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

**Example**: A meal ordering system at a restaurant where different types of meals can be constructed with various components.

### 5. Prototype Pattern

The Prototype Pattern creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as a prototype.

**Example**: A drawing application where shapes can be cloned to create new shapes.

## Usage

Each example file can be compiled and executed separately to see the pattern in action.

To run the examples:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the example files.
3. Compile the C# files using a C# compiler.
4. Execute the compiled program.
